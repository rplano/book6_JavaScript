        <h1>Variations on a Theme:<br />
          JavaScript<br />
          An object-oriented Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          by Ralph P. Lano, 1. Edition</p>
        <h3>
          Why</h3>
        <p>
          this book?&nbsp; I have always been writing little bits and pieces of JavaScript, but my preferred language
          always was Java, which is what I teach.&nbsp; What triggered this book, was a student with an iPad Pro, who
          asked if he could use it for my class.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the answer was no.&nbsp; Times change, and so did
          JavaScript.&nbsp; With the advent of ES6, some &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; was added to the language:
          classes.&nbsp; And since I really like sugar, I set myself the challenge: could I rewrite my introductory Java
          book in JavaScript?&nbsp; My main design criteria was to have as few changes as possible to convert Java
          examples to JavaScript.&nbsp; And surprisingly, it worked really well.&nbsp; This may not really be a good
          reason to write a book, but then, what is?</p>
        <h3>
          For whom</h3>
        <p>
          Well, obviously for the student with the iPad.&nbsp; Definitely, hardcore JavaScript folks will not like it,
          and this is NOT a mainstream JavaScript book.&nbsp; This is a fun project.&nbsp; And if you have little or no
          programming skills, maybe this book here will be a helpful introduction.&nbsp; If you like books with many
          pictures, then also, this book may be for you.&nbsp; But don&#39;t be fooled by the number of pages: there is
          a lot of work to be done.&nbsp; If a lot of work is not your thing, then this book probably is not for you.
        </p>
        <h3>
          From whom</h3>
        <p>
          I have been teaching Java for roughly twenty years now, in different forms, courses and universities.&nbsp; So
          naturally, this is JavaScript through the eyes of a Java developer.&nbsp; Since 2011, I have been Professor of
          Internet Programming and Multimedia Applications in the MediaEngineering program at the Nuremberg Institute of
          Technology.&nbsp; From 2003 to 2010 I was Professor of Software Engineering and Multimedia Applications at the
          University of Applied Sciences&nbsp; Hof, and from 2010 to 2011 Professor of Media and Computing at HTW
          Berlin.&nbsp; I received my doctorate in 1996 from the University of Iowa on the subject &#39;Quantum Gravity:
          Variations on a Theme&#39;.&nbsp; From 1996 to 1997 I was Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Centre for
          Theoretical Studies of the Indian Institute of Science.&nbsp; From 1997 to 2003 I worked at Pearson Education
          and later at Siemens AG in software development and project management.</p>
        <h3>
          About what</h3>
        <p>
          It&#39;s getting a bit technical now, but some people want to know what they&#39;re getting into:&nbsp; In the
          first chapter we take the first programming steps with Karel.&nbsp; We get to know functions, loops,
          conditions and our first software engineering principles.&nbsp; Above all, the top-down principle is
          introduced for the first time.&nbsp; The second chapter introduces graphics programming, we learn to use
          objects using a JavaScript version of the ACM graphics library.&nbsp; This is followed by an introduction to
          console programs.&nbsp; The point here is to get to know variables and operators, conditions and loops are
          deepened, boolean variables are introduced and the &#39;Loop and a Half&#39; is shown.&nbsp; In the chapter
          Agrar the top-down principle is deepened and functions are put on a new foundation.&nbsp; It is also shown how
          animations and mouse events work, and the random generator is used for the first time.&nbsp; Chapter five
          deals with strings and introduces classes.&nbsp; The Swing chapter introduces the basics of graphical user
          interfaces and concretizes the concept of instance variables.&nbsp; The basics of object orientation,
          inheritance and composition, will be discussed in detail in the following chapter and will be deepened by
          numerous examples.&nbsp; Arrays and simple image processing are also introduced.&nbsp; Then we finish off the
          main part with the introduction of the list and map data structures, and we conclude with interfaces and
          loosely introduce the term polymorphism.</p>
        <p>
          The appendix starts with a primer on JavaScript and some of its new features.&nbsp; This is followed by a
          brief description of each of the libraries we use in the main part.&nbsp; Especially the graphics libraries
          are nothing but a thin wrapper around the p5.js library from the Processing Foundation [7].&nbsp; The final
          chapter, is just a loose collection of idea, which is work in progress.</p>
        <h3>
          How</h3>
        <p>
          does one learn to play the piano?&nbsp; Not by watching or listening.&nbsp; It&#39;s the same with
          programming: you have to practice a lot!&nbsp; And the more you practice, the better you become with
          programming.&nbsp; We&#39;re not only learning programming here, but also actually taking our first steps in
          software engineering.&nbsp; But as Johann Sebastian Bach so nicely said: &quot;All you have to do is hit the
          right key at the right time.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          The course as I teach it, consists of three components: the lecture, the labs and homework.&nbsp; The lecture
          is four hours per week and corresponds to the first part of each chapter in the book.&nbsp; We complete one
          chapter in about one to two weeks.&nbsp; In the labs, which also last four hours a week, we then devote
          ourselves to the projects.&nbsp; We manage between four and six of the projects per lab.&nbsp; In the labs,
          the students work in teams, usually in pairs, to help each other.</p>
        <p>
          Homework is done on a weekly basis and takes about 8 to 10 hours per week.&nbsp; It is important that the
          students work alone on their homework.&nbsp; I attach great importance to the fact that the students commit
          themselves to follow the Stanford University honor code.&nbsp; The homework also doesn&#39;t have to be
          complete or work perfectly.&nbsp; The homework is discussed individually in the labs, and almost all problems
          related to the homework usually can be solved within five minutes.</p>
        <h3>
          Where</h3>
        <p>
          can I find the examples and the source code?&nbsp; You can find them on the website of the book: <a
            href="https://github.com/rplano">https://github.com/rplano</a>.&nbsp; Also, the book in electronic form,
          including updates, can be found there.&nbsp; The book in printed form is available on Amazon, in black and
          white.</p>

        <h3>
          From where</h3>
        <p>
          come the ideas?&nbsp; Since this book is almost identical to my first book, the style, the pedagogical
          structure and many of the examples are heavily inspired by Mehran Sahami&#39;s lecture [1], which in turn is
          based on the book by Eric Roberts [2].&nbsp; I personally learned JavaScript from David Flanagan&#39;s book
          [5].&nbsp; However, JavaScript has changed quite a bit over the years, and if you really want to understand
          it, you must read Douglas Crockford&#39;s book [3].&nbsp; The tutorials on W3Schools [4] are really helpful
          when you need a quick solution for a simple problem.&nbsp; Addy Osmani website [6] I really like, because it
          shows that you can write really nice, clean code with JavaScript, just take a look for yourself.</p>
